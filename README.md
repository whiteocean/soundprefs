## Abstract
There is anecdotal evidence that some sounds are universially disliked,
for example, nails on a chalkboard. Currently however, there is limited
empirical study about the properties of these sounds. Here we attempt
to identify universally disliked sounds and their common threads.

## Questions and Predictions

- What would people listen to longer, sounds that disgust, annoy, or signal danger? For example, would you rather listen to the sound of flatulence, repetitive pen clicking, or an approaching wasp swarm? Would real-world results be different than the confines of the laboratory?

- What are the qualities of sounds that are pleasing and displeasing?

- Does the pleasure or aversion to a sound change over time, with repetitive exposure?

- Do males and females find the same sounds pleasing or aversive? Do humans and animals?
