%% Sound Preferences Experiment

%Drain dripping vs rain. Why are isolated sounds coming from a
%single source more annoying? Are there just some sounds that people
%dislike? Does this overlap with miso sounds? Is it a spectrum? Gender diffs?
%What are the underlying traits of sounds that people seem to dislike? Are
%there some sounds that are pleasurable?

%Design: Play two sounds at a subject, force them to choose which one they
%would rather listen to for X amount of time. Randomly pair the sounds.
